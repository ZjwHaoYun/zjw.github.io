　嗨，大家好，欢迎访问我的个人主页。本人本科就读于郑州航空工业管理学院，研究生就读于上海大学。


## 本科学校
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate socio-technical systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.

## My background and history
郑州航空工业管理学院（Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics）[UC-Berkeley School of Information]([http://ischool.berkeley.edu](http://zua.edu.cn/))，位于河南省郑州市，是河南省人民政府与中国民用航空局共建的全日制普通本科院校，入选国家中西部高校基础能力建设工程。
学校始建于1949年，原名华北财经学校；后几经更名、数易其址，1964年与郑州航空工业技工学校合并更名为郑州航空工业学校；1978年升格为郑州航空工业管理专科学校；1984年升格本科，更名为郑州航空工业管理学院；1999年学校由中国航空工业总公司主管转变为中央与地方共建，以河南省为主的办学体制；2013年成为硕士学位授予单位。
截至2022年6月，学校占地1700余亩，建筑面积109万平方米，实验场所面积10.6万平方米；固定资产总值17.39亿多元，教学科研仪器设备总值3.26亿元，图书馆藏书255.67万册，电子图书58.03万册；下设16个教学院（部），1个书院，1个中外合作办学机构南乌拉尔学院，1个继续教育学院；开办62个本科专业；拥有7个一级学科硕士学位授权点、15个专业硕士学位授权类别；有教职工2083人，全日制本专科生、研究生、留学生31092人。

<!-- I received my Ph.D from the [UC-Berkeley School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu), my M.A. from the [Communication, Culture, and Technology program](http://cct.georgetown.edu) at Georgetown University, and my B.A. in [the Humanities program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/humanities/) at the University of Texas at Austin. For just under five years after receiving my Ph.D, I was at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) as a staff ethnographer. At BIDS, I was first a postdoctoral scholar, then became a principal investigator and led several research and education efforts, including the institute’s Data Science Studies efforts and the [Best Practices in Data Science](https://osf.io/ctfqn/) series.

## My intellectual communities
I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
